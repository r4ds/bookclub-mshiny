# Preface {.unnumbered}

The preface chapter will not be studied as part of the book-club.
It provides an overview of the purpose of `shiny`, a brief description of
the main components of a `shiny` app and an introduction to reactive
programming.
All these ideas are studied in more detail in the later chapters (hence, why
we've skipped it).

There are some notes on setting up R/RStudio for developing shiny apps, on the
packages that should be installed, and some pointers about deploying shiny
apps.
When shiny-apps are developed as part of the book-club, we will typically
deploy them to the R4DS shinyapps.io account.
[shinyapps.io](https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/getting-started.html#deploying-applications)
has a lot of detail on releasing shiny-apps to the world.

If you have any questions / problems setting up shiny for local use, or with
deployment of a shiny app to shinyapps.io, feel free to ask in either the
"book_club-mastering_shiny" or the "help-4-shiny" channel on the R4DS slack.
