## Book club meetings {-}

- Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book.
  - **This is the best way to learn the material.**
- Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter.
- More information about how to present is available in the [github repo](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-mshiny).
- Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the [R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel](https://r4ds.io/youtube).
