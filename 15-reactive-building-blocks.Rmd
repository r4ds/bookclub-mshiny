# Reactive Building Blocks

**Learning Objectives**

- Building blocks:
  - Reactive values
  - Reactive expressions
  - Observers

- How these tools are built from low-level functions:
  - `observe()`
  - `isolate()`
  
- How error messages / signal conditions move on reactive graph

- Shiny reactive values are built on reference-semantics

## Types of Reactive Values {-}

|     |**reactiveVal()**|**reactiveValues()**|
|:----|:----------------|:-------------------|
|Holds|A **single** reactive value|A **list** of reactive values|
|Definition|`x <- reactiveVal(1)`|`x <- reactiveValues(a = 1, b = 2)`|
|Getting syntax|`x()`|`x$a`|
|Setting syntax|`x(2)`|`x$a <- 2`|
|Class|reactiveVal reactive function|reactivevalues|

## Copy-on-modify Semantics {-}

If you create an object with some value.

```{r}
x1 <- 10
```

And you copy the same value on a new object.

```{r}
x2 <- x1
```

## Copy-on-modify Semantics {-}

Then if you modify the original object.

```{r}
x2 <- 20
```

That won't change the value of the original object.

```{r}
x1
```


## Copy-on-modify Semantics {-}

If we create a list.

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1, b = 1)
```

And a function to modify the element "a" of the list.

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  x$a = 2
  invisible(x)
}
```

## Copy-on-modify Semantics {-}

After applying the function to the original list will return a new object.

```{r}
f(x) |> unlist()
```

Rather than modifying the original list.

```{r}
x |> unlist()
```

## Reference Semantics (shiny) {-}

If you are working in the server function of the app.

```{r}
library(shiny)

reactiveConsole(TRUE)
```

You can copy the value of a reactive value to new object.

```{r}
b1 <- reactiveValues(x = 10)

b2 <- b1
```

But if you change the original reactive variable.

```{r}
b1$x <- 20
```

Then the copy also changes.

```{r}
b2$x
```

## Reference Semantics (R6) {-}

If you create a new object R6 object.

```{r}
y1 <- R6::R6Class("Y", list(a = 1, b = 1))$new()
```

An you copy that object.

```{r}
y2 <- y1
```

## Reference Semantics (R6) {-}

Then if you modify the value of the new object.

```{r}
y2$b <- 2
```

Then the original object also changes.

```{r}
y1 |> unlist()
```

## Reference Semantics (R6) {-}

If a function changes the value of the original object.

```{r}
f(y1)
```

Then the copy also get changed.

```{r}
y2
```

## Exercises {-}

1. *What are the differences between these two lists of reactive values? Compare the syntax for getting and setting individual reactive values.*

```{r}
# Defining values
l1 <- reactiveValues(a = 1, b = 2)
l2 <- list(a = reactiveVal(1), b = reactiveVal(2))
# ... with a little extra
l3 <- reactiveVal(list(a = 1, b = 2))
```

```r
# Getting
l1$a; l1[["a"]]
l2$a(); l2[["a"]]()
l3()$a; l3()[["a"]]

# Setting
l1$a <- 15
l2$a(15)
# For l3, can't easily update just 'a'
l3(list(a = 15, b = 2))
```

## Exercises {-}

2. *Design and perform a small experiment to verify that reactiveVal() also has reference semantics.*

```{r}
# If we define 3 objects
x <- reactiveVal(1)
y <- x
z <- reactiveVal(1)

# If we change the value of x
x(2)

# Then y also changes
x()
y()

# But z keeps the same
z()
```

## Reactive Expressions: Cached Errors {-}

Errors are **cached** just as values.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
r <- reactive(stop("Error occured at ", Sys.time(), call. = FALSE))
r()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
r <- reactive(stop("Error occured at ", Sys.time(), call. = FALSE))
try(r())
```

So if you run it again, it **won't update** the message.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(2)
r()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(2)
try(r())
```

## Reactive Expressions: Propagated Errors{-}

Errors are **propagated** through the reactive graph just as values, but they present different behavior when they reach an:

- **Output**: The error will be displayed in the app.
- **Observer**: The error will cause the current session to terminate.
  - This can be avoided by wrapping the code in `try()` or `tryCatch()` functions.

*From: examples/15-reactive-blocks/01-error-propagated-example.R*

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| file: examples/15-reactive-blocks/01-error-propagated-example.R
```

## Reactive Expressions: Errors `seq()` {-}

If some error is present in next function:

- Observers and outputs to **stop what they’re doing** but not otherwise fail.
- By default, it will cause outputs to reset to their **initial blank state**, unless `req(..., cancelOutput = TRUE)` they’ll preserve their current display.

*From: examples/15-reactive-blocks/02-seq-error-example.R*

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| file: examples/15-reactive-blocks/02-seq-error-example.R
```


## Where does `on.exit()` work? {-}

`on.exit()` can be used on:

- Inside [function bodies](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#on-exit)
- In [testthat expressions](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/self-cleaning-test-fixtures/)
- In a **reactive expression or observer**

When does `on.exit()` run?

- In functions, the code in `on.exit()` runs after all the rest of the code has run.

- It runs even if there are errors / warnings.

- You can have multiple calls to `on.exit()` inside a function (use add = TRUE, so a call doesn't overwrite an earlier one)


## Applications of `on.exit()` {-}

- Set an R option
- Set an environment variable
- Change working directory
- Create a file or directory
- Create a resource on an external system

```{r}
neat <- function(x, sig_digits) {
  op <- options(digits = sig_digits)
  on.exit(options(op), add = TRUE)
  print(x)
}

neat(pi, 2)

pi
```

## Observers and Outputs {-}

Observers and outputs are terminal nodes in the reactive graph.

- Reactives : cached and lazy
- Observers / Outputs : forgetful and eager *(if they were lazy, nothing would get done)*

![](images/15-reactive-blocks/01-output-observer-reactive-graph.png)

## Observers and Outputs {-}

`observeEvent()` is used for:

- Saving a file to a shared network drive
- Sending data to a web API
- Updating a database
- Printing a debugging message to the console

> The **value returned by an observer is ignored** because they are designed to work with functions called for their side-effects

In the other side, **Outputs**:

- Running `output$text <- ...` creates the observer.
- They can detect when they're not **visible** so they don't have to **recompute**

## `observe()` Function {-}

Observers and Outputs use `observe()`.

`observe()` sets up a block of code that is run **every time one** of the reactive values or expressions it uses is updated.

```r
y <- reactiveVal(10)
observe({
  message("`y` is ", y())
})
#> `y` is 10

y(5)
#> `y` is 5
y(4)
#> `y` is 4
```

## `observe()` Propertites {-}

Every time you run the `observe()` function it **creates** an action that can be triggered.

In the next example, every time x changes, it creates another observer, so its value is printed another time.

```r
x <- reactiveVal(1)
y <- observe({
  x()
  observe(print(x()))
})
#> [1] 1
x(2)
#> [1] 2
#> [1] 2
x(3)
#> [1] 3
#> [1] 3
#> [1] 3
```

> You should only ever create **observers or outputs at the top-level** of your server function.


## Isolating Code {-}

To avoid creating reactive dependencies when not needed, we can use the functions:

- `isolate()`
- `observeEvent()`
- `eventReactive()`

## Using the `isolate` Function {-}

For example, the next code creates an **infinite loop** because the observer will take a reactive dependency on `x` **and** `count`.

```r
r <- reactiveValues(count = 0, x = 1)
observe({
  r$x
  r$count <- r$count + 1
})
```

As we don't want to create dependency based on `r$count` we can isolate it.

```r
r <- reactiveValues(count = 0, x = 1)

observe({
  r$x
  r$count <- isolate(r$count) + 1
})

r$x <- 1
r$x <- 2
r$count
#> [1] 2

r$x <- 3
r$count
#> [1] 3
```


## Using the `observeEvent` Function {-}

But if we need to isolate many variables in a script is better to use `observeEvent(x, y)` which is equivalent to `observe({x; isolate(y)})` to get the same results.

```r
observeEvent(r$x, { 
  r$count <- r$count + 1 
}) 

r$x <- 8
r$count
#> [1] 4
```

`eventReactive(x, y)` on the other hand is equivalent to use `reactive({x; isolate(y)})`


## `observeEvent` and `eventReactive` arguments {-}

- `ignoreNULL = FALSE` to also handle NULL values, rather than ignoring any event that yields NULL.

- `ignoreInit = TRUE` to avoid running the functions the functions once when you create them.

- `once = TRUE` to run the handler only once.

*From: examples/15-reactive-blocks/03-isolate-example.R*

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| file: examples/15-reactive-blocks/03-isolate-example.R
```

## Review to `reactiveTimer()` {-}

![](images/15-reactive-blocks/02-timing-timer.png)

```r
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  timer <- reactiveTimer(500)
  
  x1 <- reactive({
    timer()
    rpois(input$n, input$lambda1)
  })
  x2 <- reactive({
    timer()
    rpois(input$n, input$lambda2)
  })
  
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    freqpoly(x1(), x2(), binwidth = 1, xlim = c(0, 40))
  }, res = 96)
}
```

## Understanding `invalidateLater(ms)` {-}

After `ms` milliseconds it causes any **reactive consumer to be invalidated**.

That is useful for:

- Creating animations
- Connecting to data sources outside of Shiny’s reactive framework

## Understanding `invalidateLater(ms)` {-}

Generate 10 fresh random normals every half a second

```r
x <- reactive({
  invalidateLater(500)
  rnorm(10)
})
```

## Understanding `invalidateLater(ms)` {-}

Increment a cumulative sum with a random number

```r
sum <- reactiveVal(0)
observe({
  invalidateLater(300)
  sum(isolate(sum()) + runif(1))
})
```

## Importing data {-}

To import data only when the data have been updated you can use the `reactivePoll()` function.

```r
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  data <- reactivePoll(1000, session, 
    function() file.mtime("data.csv"),
    function() read.csv("data.csv")
  )
}
```

But for this simple example we can also use `reactiveFileReader()` function.

```r
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  data <- reactiveFileReader(1000, session, "data.csv", read.csv)
}
```

## Long running reactives {-}

In the next code we are invalidating the result before ending a log process which ends in an **infinitive invalidation loop**.

```r
x <- reactive({

  # Invalidation
  invalidateLater(500)
  
  # Long Process
  Sys.sleep(1)
  
  # Output
  10
})
```

But if we wrap the invalidation function into an `on.exit` function, we will make sure to run check after ending the process.

```r
x <- reactive({

  # Invalidation
  on.exit(invalidateLater(500), add = TRUE)
  
  # Long Process
  Sys.sleep(1)
  
  # Output
  10
})
```

## Timer accuracy {-}

The number of milliseconds specified in `invalidateLater()` is a **polite request**, not a demand. 

This effectively means that the **invalidation might take longer** than you expect.
