# 2021-05-18: Discussion with Colin Fay

Colin Fay has kindly accepted an invite to talk to our Mastering Shiny bookclub members.
At the point that Colin joins us, we have studied the first two parts of Mastering Shiny.
The next parts of the book go in-depth on the reactive computational  model underpinning
Shiny and some engineering practices (modularity, testing) that help when building
larger Shiny apps.

Colin is a Shiny expert who was one of the technical reviewers for "Mastering Shiny".
He works at ThinkR in France, and is an author of the book
["Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps"](https://engineering-shiny.org/)
and of the [{golem} framework](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) for building Shiy Apps.

We asked the mastering-shiny bookclub attendees how they would like the meeting with
Colin organising:
"Would you like a q+a, would you like to see one of Colin's apps, or get his feedback on
your own shiny code/projects, would you like him to do a talk?"

The feedback was:
- [Lalit] Some tips and tricks while developing apps
- [Priyanka] some of his preferred ways of troubleshooting and testing Shiny (and R scripts
 in general)
- [Layla] Walk-through of one of his apps
- [Federica] App walk-through and tips

It was discussed that if we had a Q&A then we should prepare some questions beforehand.
