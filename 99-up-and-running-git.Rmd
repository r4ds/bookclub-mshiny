# Up and running with `git`

**Learning objectives**

- Understand *what `git` is and how to use it in a basic workflow*
- Understand *what GitHub is and how to use it in a basic workflow*
- Review the *different `git` commands used in a basic workflow*
- Apply *`git` commands to complete a basic workflow*
- Observe a *basic workflow using RStudio's Git GUI*
- Observe a *basic workflow using the terminal in RStudio*

## What is `git`?

* `git` is a version control system. 

* Assists developers* when collaborating on big projects.
    
  + *Data scientists and analysts have adapted it for their needs.

* Manages the set of files (i.e., a *repository (or repo for short)*) in a structured way.

* Two ways to think about `git`:

   + It takes snapshots, catalogs, and assists in the documentation of changes to your files.

   + It is like Microsoft Word's "Track Changes" on steroids.

## Accessing and using `git`

A myriad of ways are available to use `git` in your workflow (assuming `git` is installed on your computer).

The two most common are:

(@) Using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Client (you must install some of these)

   i) Examples can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).
   i) Built in Git window pane in RStudio

(@) Using terminal commands

   i) System terminal
   i) Rstudio terminal
    
## Example using the built in RStudio `git` GUI.

* Here's an example of the Git window pane in Rstudio.

* Here's an example of the `git` sub-menu in RStudio.

## Example using `git` in a system terminal

* Here's an example using a system terminal. Terminal is set up with [`oh my zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/) running on a Mac Computer.

### Example using `git` in RStudio's terminal

* Here's an example of using RStudio's integrated terminal (Windows users might find this useful). 
* This tab should be near the `Console` tab. If not, you may have to adjust your settings or open a new terminal.

## What is GitHub?

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a hosting service for your projects.

> Think of it as DropBox, but much, much better ~Jenny Bryan, STAT 545 TAs, & Jim Hester (Happy Git and GitHub for the useR)

* It's a collaboration, project management, and social media platform. 

* Provides many tools to improve/work on your project.

### Other services like GitHub

* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

![](images/99-up-and-running-git/Bitbucket@2x-blue.png)

* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

![](images/99-up-and-running-git/git-lab-logo.png)

* Although these services are different, the fundamentals are still the same across the platforms. 

## A basic workflow - pull, commit, and push

* There are many tools that `git` and GitHub provides. 
    + Just check out the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). 

* Let's look at a basic, common workflow: tracking and documenting changes to our project.
    + `pull`, `commit`, and `push`

## Personal repo workflow step-by-step

* Here's a step-by-step visualization of the workflow. 
        
  + These are the common steps and there are many approaches to do what is explained here. 

  + Using these commands in the same steps might not matter. You will find yourself using similar patterns over and over, however. 
    
      - **Pull, make changes, add, commit, push**

  + The commands you use and in what order you use them is based on the current state of the project.

## Personal repo workflow alternative view

* Here's the same workflow. It is just visualized a different way.

## Fork, clone, push, and pull workflow (collaboration)

* This diagram is from the [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR book](https://happygitwithr.com/). 

* **This is how you can make changes to the bookclub's review materials.**

* It overviews the workflow when working with a forked repository.

* We will come back to this at a later time, once we start developing the app.

### Some notes about these workflows
* They will not always run smoothly
   + Errors and issues are inevitable (merge conflicts...ugh)
   + Read the prompts and try to solve the issue, Google is your friend
   
* Git can be frustrating at times
   + Don't worry about being perfect
   + Getting good takes practice

## Workflow commands

* The following are common commands to perform the previously discussed workflow in a terminal. 

* `git` has many commands, each having multiple options to modify behavior. 

    + Want to know more, check out the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).   

### Get Remote Repo/Update Local Repo
    
  * `git clone <repo url>` (only needs to be run once*): pulls files into a directory (file)
  * `git pull`: retrieves changes from the remote repo

### View info about local files

  * `git branch`: see what branch you are on locally.
  * `git status`: see what files have changed locally.
  * `git diff`: see specific changes in the files.
    
### Stage and document changes

  * `git checkout <branch name>`: change your branch if needed.
  * `git add <file name>`: stage the file for documentation.
  * `git add -i`: interactive module for staging. Great for when you have lots of files to commit.
  * `git commit`: opens text editor to document changes.
     + If `vim` opens: Press `i` (insert) >> add your subject line >> draft your message >> `Esc` >> `:+x` >> `Enter`.
  * `git commit -m <message>`: Short version for drafting commit messages. 
    
### Push changes to remote repository    
    
  * `git push`: push changes to remote repo (GitHub)

## Demo of the workflow

1. Workflow using the GUI

    * Video will be added soon

2. Workflow using the terminal

    * Video will be added soon
