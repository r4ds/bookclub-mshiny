# Why reactivity?

**Learning objectives**

We want to improve our **intuitive understanding** based on applying reactivity.

- What is reactivity or reactive programming?
- Why is it used in Shiny?

 
## Shiny is good magic {-}

If you check the layers of reactive programming:

- You won't find a pile of heuristics, **special cases**, and **hacks**

- The magic comes from **simple concepts combined** in consistent ways
 
## What is reactive programming? {-}
 
- It's a paradigm which focuses on **values that change** over time, and calculations and actions that **depend on those values**

- It is concerned with **data streams** (_sequence of data elements_) and the **propagation of changes**

## Why reactive programming in Shiny? {-}

- **The problem**
  - We want to keep sync inputs & outputs
  - But we need to minimize the computation

- **The solution**
  - Outputs and reactive expressions change _if and only if_ their inputs change

## Why can't you use variables? {-}

**Variables don't update automatically** when a prior value changes

```{r why-not-variables, eval = FALSE}
temp_c <- 10
temp_f <- (temp_c * 9 / 5) + 32
temp_f
#> [1] 50

temp_c <- 30

# temp_f not automatically updated
temp_f
#> [1] 50
```

## Why can't you use functions? {-}

They address the issue of automatic updating but require **excessive computation**.

```{r what-about-functions, eval = FALSE}
temp_c <- 10
temp_f <- function() {
  message("Converting") 
  (temp_c * 9 / 5) + 32
}
temp_f()
#> Converting
#> [1] 50

# temp_f automatically updated
temp_c <- -3
temp_f() 
#> Converting
#> [1] 26.6

# but does unnecessary computation (recomputes every time it's called)
temp_f() 
#> Converting
#> [1] 26.6
```


## Event-driven programming {-}

This method callback functions that run in **response to events** like:

- Clicking a button
- Running a function to process order

We can define events using the `R6` package in R.

```{r event-driven-programming-class-def, eval = FALSE}
DynamicValue <- R6::R6Class("DynamicValue", list(
  value = NULL,
  on_update = NULL,
  
  get = function() self$value,

  set = function(value) {
    self$value <- value
    if (!is.null(self$on_update)) 
      self$on_update(value)
    invisible(self)
  },
  
  onUpdate = function(on_update) {
    self$on_update <- on_update
    invisible(self)
  }
))
```

## Event-driven limitation {-}

It solves problem of _unnecessary computation_, but makes **hard to track which inputs** affect which computations.

```{r event-driven-programming-class-usage, eval = FALSE}
temp_c <- DynamicValue$new()
temp_c$onUpdate(function(value) {
  message("Converting") 
  temp_f <<- (value * 9 / 5) + 32
})

temp_c$set(10)
#> Converting
temp_f
#> [1] 50

temp_c$set(-3)
#> Converting
temp_f
#> [1] 26.6
```

## Reactive programming {-}

Reactive programming combines features of solutions we've seen so far.

```{r reactive-programming, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
reactiveConsole(TRUE) # let's us use reactivity in console

temp_c <- reactiveVal(10) # create
temp_c()                  # get
#> [1] 10
temp_c(20)                # set
temp_c()                  # get
#> [1] 20


temp_f <- reactive({
  message("Converting") 
  (temp_c() * 9 / 5) + 32
})
temp_f()
#> Converting
#> [1] 68

# temp_f automatically updates
temp_c(-10)
temp_f()
#> Converting
#> [1] 14

# _and_ only computes when needed (don't see "Converting")
temp_f()
#> [1] 14
```

## Properties of reactive expressions {-}

- **Lazy**: only does work when it's called
- **Cached**: Saves last result, to only work on first call

## History of reactive programming {-}

- It started with spreadsheets! (VisCalc, 1979)

- Not really studied academically until late 1990s

- In 2010s became mainstream
  - JavaScript UI frameworks: Knockout, Ember, Meteor _(inspiration for Shiny)_
  - Now: React, Vue, Angular
  
- "Reactive programming" is a **general term** a lot of different implementations can fill that concept

00:05:22	Russ Hyde:	There are lots of chapters available if anyone would like to do a talk over the next few weeks.
00:05:37	Russ Hyde:	Myself and Diamantis have the next couple of weeks planned.
00:06:16	Russ Hyde:	But there's another chapter in the Reactivity section and all-but-one of the best-practices chapters available
00:06:50	Andrew MacDonald (he/him):	hello everyone! :
00:06:53	Andrew MacDonald (he/him):	:D
00:06:57	Russ Hyde:	Those chapters take us up to mid-august.
00:07:13	Russ Hyde:	And hopefully we'll all be expert shiny devs by then ...
00:09:14	Layla Bouzoubaa:	I think I can do functions
00:09:19	Layla Bouzoubaa:	*think*
00:10:44	Andrew MacDonald (he/him):	I could be an understudy for ch16 :)
00:12:03	Russ Hyde:	Layla, if you'd like to do functions that would be great
00:12:33	Layla Bouzoubaa:	Ok, I‚Äôll go ahead and put it in the books
00:12:39	Layla Bouzoubaa:	6/29
